# Advanced Lane Finding
<<<<<<< HEAD
---
Project Steps
- [x] Compute the camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients given a set of chessboard images.
- [x] Apply a distortion correction to raw images.
- [ ] Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image.
- [x] Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").
- [x] Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.
- [ ] Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.
- [ ] Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.
- [ ] Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.
